# book-notes

Hi!

Welcome to my book corner. In this repository you can find notes I've been taking while reading my books.

## Flatnotes

I use [flatnotes](https://github.com/dullage/flatnotes) to take notes and then synchronize them periodically (every 10 minutes) using `rsync` and `cron`.

```bash
./rsync <flatnotes_content_dir_path>
```
